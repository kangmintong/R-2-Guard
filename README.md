### Evaluations on standard safety benchmark

```bash scripts.sh```

### Evaluations against jailbreaks

For GCG attack:

```bash scripts.sh```

In ``scripts.sh``, please specify the corresponding adv_string (adv_string_1: GCG-U1; adv_string_2: GCG-U2; adv_string_3: GCG-V; adv_string_4: GCG-L; adv_string_5: GCG-R)

For AutoDAN, TAP, PAIR attack:
